Algorithmic trading involves creating sophisticated models that use mathematical algorithms to execute trades automatically. These models can analyze market data, identify trading opportunities, and execute orders at high speeds and volumes. By leveraging historical and real-time data, algorithmic trading strategies aim to maximize returns and minimize risks. They can adapt to changing market conditions and execute complex trading strategies that would be difficult for a human trader to perform manually.
