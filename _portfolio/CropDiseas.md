Crop disease detection is a project that utilizes image recognition technology to identify diseases in crops at an early stage. By analyzing images of plants taken with cameras or drones, machine learning algorithms can detect signs of disease such as discoloration, spots, or abnormal growth patterns. Early detection allows farmers to take timely action to treat affected crops, preventing the spread of disease and minimizing yield loss.
