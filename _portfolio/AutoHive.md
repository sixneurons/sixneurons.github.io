AutoHive is a groundbreaking project at the intersection of technology and apiculture, aiming to automate and optimize the beekeeping process through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision systems. Traditional beekeeping methods are labor-intensive and often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming, inefficient, and sometimes detrimental to the bees.
