Product recommendation systems are algorithms designed to personalize product suggestions for users based on their browsing and purchasing history. These systems analyze user data to identify patterns and preferences, enabling them to recommend items that the user is more likely to be interested in. By providing tailored recommendations, e-commerce platforms can enhance the shopping experience, increase customer engagement, and boost sales.
