Yield prediction models are used to forecast crop yields based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, plant health, and historical yield data. These models help farmers plan their planting schedules, manage resources effectively, and make informed decisions about crop sales and distribution. Accurate yield predictions are crucial for ensuring food security and optimizing supply chains.
