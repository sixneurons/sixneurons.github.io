Customer behavior analysis is the study of consumer actions and preferences to understand trends and patterns. Retailers use this information to tailor marketing strategies, personalize shopping experiences, and improve product offerings. By analyzing data from various touchpoints, such as purchase history, online browsing behavior, and social media interactions, retailers can gain insights into what drives customer decisions and how to better meet their needs.
