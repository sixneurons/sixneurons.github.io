Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales to inform business decisions. Retailers use historical sales data, market trends, and economic indicators to predict future performance. Accurate sales forecasts help businesses plan for production, manage inventory, allocate resources efficiently, and set realistic revenue targets. This strategic tool is vital for long-term planning and ensuring the financial health of a retail operation.
