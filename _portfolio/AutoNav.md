The development of autonomous vehicle navigation systems is a cutting-edge project in the field of transportation. These systems enable self-driving cars to navigate safely and efficiently without human intervention. They rely on a combination of sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence to perceive the environment, make decisions, and control the vehicleâ€™s movements. This technology has the potential to revolutionize transportation by improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and providing mobility solutions for those unable to drive.
