Medical image segmentation is a process that involves using deep learning algorithms to accurately delineate and separate different structures within medical images, such as MRI or CT scans. This technique is crucial for enhancing the diagnosis and treatment planning of various diseases. By training models on large datasets of annotated images, these algorithms can learn to identify and isolate specific anatomical regions or pathologies, providing clinicians with detailed visualizations that aid in making more informed decisions.
