Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other characteristics. This allows e-commerce businesses to target specific segments with personalized marketing campaigns, promotions, and product offerings. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of different customer groups, retailers can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
