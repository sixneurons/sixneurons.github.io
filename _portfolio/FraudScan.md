Fraud detection in finance uses machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. By analyzing patterns in transaction data, these systems can flag unusual activities that may indicate fraud. This includes monitoring for irregular spending patterns, verifying the authenticity of transactions, and detecting anomalies that deviate from a userâ€™s typical behavior. Effective fraud detection systems help protect both financial institutions and customers from financial losses due to fraudulent activities.
