Traffic flow optimization is a project aimed at reducing congestion on roads and highways. By using predictive analytics, this project analyzes traffic patterns and predicts future congestion points. The goal is to implement strategies that can alleviate traffic jams, such as dynamic traffic signal timing, variable speed limits, and real-time traffic information dissemination to drivers. This not only improves travel times but also reduces fuel consumption and emissions.
