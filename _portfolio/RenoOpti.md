Renewable energy optimization focuses on maximizing the efficiency of renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric systems. The goal is to enhance energy production while minimizing costs and environmental impact. This project may involve the development of advanced control systems that can adjust the operation of renewable energy installations based on weather conditions and energy demand. Additionally, it may include research into new materials and technologies that can improve the performance and durability of renewable energy equipment.
