Inventory management in retail involves predicting stock levels to ensure that the right amount of product is available at the right time. This process uses data analytics and forecasting models to optimize inventory levels, reducing both overstock and stockouts. By accurately predicting demand, retailers can minimize holding costs, improve cash flow, and enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring popular items are always in stock.
