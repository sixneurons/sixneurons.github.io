Personalized treatment refers to the development of tailored medical interventions based on individual patient data. This approach leverages algorithms that analyze genetic information, lifestyle factors, and medical history to predict how a patient will respond to certain treatments. The goal is to optimize therapeutic strategies for each person, improving outcomes and minimizing side effects. Personalized medicine represents a shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all model to a more precise and patient-centric healthcare paradigm.
