Content moderation on social media platforms involves automatically detecting and filtering out inappropriate content such as hate speech, violence, and explicit material. This is achieved through machine learning algorithms that analyze text, images, and videos to identify content that violates community guidelines. Effective content moderation helps maintain a safe and respectful online environment for users.
