Credit scoring is the process of building predictive models to assess an individualâ€™s creditworthiness. These models analyze various factors such as credit history, income, employment status, and other financial behaviors to predict the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. The resulting credit score helps lenders make informed decisions about whether to extend credit and at what interest rate. Accurate credit scoring models are essential for maintaining the health of the financial system by reducing the risk of default.
