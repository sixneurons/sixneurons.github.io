Pollution monitoring involves the use of sensors and machine learning algorithms to track pollution levels in the environment. This project aims to provide real-time data on air and water quality by deploying a network of sensors that can detect pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and heavy metals. Machine learning techniques are then applied to analyze the data collected by these sensors, enabling the identification of pollution sources and trends. This information is crucial for public health, environmental protection, and policy-making.
