Route planning algorithms are essential for optimizing logistics and delivery operations. These algorithms calculate the most efficient routes for vehicles to take, considering factors such as distance, traffic conditions, delivery windows, and vehicle capacity. By finding the optimal paths, companies can reduce transportation costs, improve delivery times, and minimize their environmental footprint.
