Trend analysis in social media is the process of identifying trending topics, hashtags, and viral content. By analyzing large volumes of data from posts, comments, and shares, algorithms can detect patterns that indicate what is currently popular or gaining attention. This information is valuable for marketers, content creators, and platform managers to stay relevant and engage with their audience effectively.
