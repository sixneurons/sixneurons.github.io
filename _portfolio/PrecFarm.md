Precision farming involves optimizing resource use through data-driven farming techniques. This project uses sensors, GPS technology, and data analytics to monitor soil conditions, crop health, and weather patterns. Farmers can then apply water, fertilizers, and pesticides more efficiently and only where needed. Precision farming leads to higher crop yields, reduced environmental impact, and lower production costs.
